# yes-twilio-faq

The purpose of this repo is to provide context as to Your Employment Solutions' use-case of Twilio chatbot opt-in.

We plan on including a SMS opt-in for our chatbot flow on our [website application form](https://www.youremploymentsolutions.com/) located by clicking Job Seekers -> [Apply Online](https://hire.myavionte.com/sonar/v2/careers/integrations/standalone/general?bId=MQymcezo33c&jbId=JJjnVS9QRLc&rpid=general).

Additionally, once the user submits an application, we initially send them a text message asking permission to text them. The text looks like:

`Hi there! My name is Eddie, I am a scheduler for Your Employment Solutions (Y.E.S). I just noticed your application come through on our website. Thank you for applying for one of our jobs! I will help you get an interview date and time scheduled! Reply with "YES" to let me know you are ready to get get started. Reply "STOP" to opt-out at any time.`

The applicant's opt-in status is then stored in our ATS (applicant tracking software).
